# THINGS TO DO

- create the main four CPU instructions:
ADD ACCUMULATOR,
LOAD ACCUMULATOR, STORE ACCUMULATOR, HALT

- make three bit inner counter
- make a control unit
- GOLD GREAT GOAL WILL BE HAVE THE JUMP INSTRUCTION SIMULATED

make the STORE ACCUMULATOR 
WE NEED TO WRITE TO THE RAM WHEN THE INS CLK ITS ON 10
THE VALUE THAT IS CURRENTLY LOADED TO THE ACCUMULATOR
TO THE ADDRESS THATS FETCHED FROM THE INSTRUCTION FETCHING

make the reset signals if needed. (WHEN TRYING TO PUT STORE AFTER LOAD OR VICEVERSA)

the add accumulator is to sum out whats in the specified adr location to
the value that is in the accumulator
